### Configuration

You can modify the texts of the pages in the constant files that are in `src/config/constants/`

### Markdown documents

Static pages are generated from Markdown files located in the `public/markdown` folder. These files must have unique names and follow the Markdown format. The attributes `name` and `layout` are mandatory, while `kicker`, `title` and `sub_title` are optional. For virus related Markdown files, the `species` attribute is also required.

- virus file

```text
---
name: Guanarito virus
species:
  - Zygodontomys brevicauda
  - Sigmodon alstoni
layout: virus
---

# Guanarito virus
....

```

- home file

```text
---
name: home
kicker:
title: AtlasArena
sub_title: Climate change alters human risk for infectious diseases
layout: page
---

AtlasArena is a **Wellcome Trust**-funded
```

#### Considerations for Markdown documents:

- You can add images and store them in the `images` folder:

```text
![image](images/image.webp)
```

- There are 4 types of documents (`virus, specie, page, publications`) these types are specified in the layout attribute.
- All files must have a `name` and `layout` field.
